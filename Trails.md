# Trials

Access to the V5 brain is limited to in person weeks, writing code for a piece of equipments without access to it is very dificult.

It was observed that the V5 brain uses python code that is simlar to that of micropython, therefore the code with written in micropython with the interntion of converting it to V5 Brain during the next in person week (March 2025)

## Writing code for the RPI pico in micropython, and the arduino nano

A communication proticol cannot be tested on its own, it needs to communicate with another module in order to test it, therefore code was written for the arduino and the rpi pico simultaniusly.

In order to make the code easy to use, a callback function is implimented

during this period it was found that the sometimes the code results in an error


# In person week March 2025

Upload the V5 brain code to the brain to see if communications bettween the brain and another microcontroller can be made.
